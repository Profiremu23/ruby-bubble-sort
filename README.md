# ruby-bubble-sort
My fourth Ruby project made for the Odin Project (TOP). It is a simple sorting script that will work on any given array by comparing the index values within that said array. It will swap a pair of index values if array index value A is bigger than array index value B, and repeat until every value within the array is fully sorted.

## How To Run It?
In order to run this simple piece of software, open a Git/Linux/Mac terminal and navigate to ../ruby-bubble-sort, then run by entering ruby bubble-sort.rb.

## Editing the Array
You can edit the array example in the bubble-sort.rb file at line 11 by default, just make sure you have the numbers separated by commas (,) within the brackets ([])!
